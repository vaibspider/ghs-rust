This is a GHS Algorithm (to compute Distributed Minimum Spanning Tree) implementation in Rust.

Build command:
1. cargo build or 
2. cargo build --release

Run GHS:
1. ./target/debug/ghs <input-file> or
2. ./target/release/ghs <input-file>

Input for GHS is a connected, undirected graph with unique edge weights.

Format for 'input-file':
See example file - "input".
The first line is the number of nodes in the input graph.
Every line following the first line is an edge in the format - (nodeindex, nodeindex, weight).
